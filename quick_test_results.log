=== Quick DNF Performance Comparison ===
Testing parallel vs serial DNF modes with the same workload

Test configuration: --user-mode --dry-run --max-packages 15 --name-filter 'bash'

TEST 1: Parallel DNF Mode (default)
=====================================
[I] Using parallel DNF mode with max 4 concurrent processes
[I] Repository metadata download completed in 12s
Parallel mode total time: 20s

TEST 2: Serial DNF Mode
=======================
[I] Using serial DNF mode to prevent database lock contention
[I] Repository metadata download completed in 11s
Serial mode total time: 19s

PERFORMANCE COMPARISON:
======================
Parallel mode: 20s
Serial mode:   19s
Result: Serial mode is 5% faster!
Recommendation: Use --dnf-serial flag for better performance
