**Maintained by**: DÃ¡niel NÃ©methy (nemethy@moderato.hu)

## Current Implementation Status

âœ… **Already Implemented Features** (removed from this document):
- Configuration file support (`myrepo.cfg`)
- Log level control with color support
- Batch processing capabilities  
- Parallel processing with job control
- Repository exclusion functionality
- Cache configuration with time-based settings

ðŸ“‹ **Remaining Improvement Opportunities**

## Performance Improvements

### 1. **Repository metadata caching enhancement**
   - **Current**: The script has basic time-based caching (refresh after X hours)
   - **Improvement**: Add cache versioning and dependency tracking
   - **Benefit**: More intelligent cache invalidation based on actual changes

### 2. **Parallel processing optimization**
   - **Current**: Uses basic `wait_for_jobs` approach with fixed parallel limits
   - **Improvement**: Implement dynamic job scheduling based on system resources
   - **Benefit**: Better resource utilization and adaptive performance

### 3. **DNF operations batching**
   - **Current**: Individual DNF operations for each package
   - **Improvement**: Batch multiple package operations together
   - **Benefit**: Reduced overhead and faster processing

## Error Handling and Logging

### 1. **Enhanced error recovery**
   - **Current**: Basic continue-on-error functionality exists
   - **Improvement**: Add exponential backoff retries for transient failures
   - **Benefit**: Better resilience against temporary network/system issues

### 2. **Log rotation and management**
   - **Current**: Comprehensive logging with levels and colors
   - **Improvement**: Add automatic log rotation and archival
   - **Benefit**: Prevent log files from growing indefinitely

### 3. **Structured logging for automation**
   - **Current**: Human-readable log format
   - **Improvement**: Add JSON/structured output option for machine parsing
   - **Benefit**: Better integration with monitoring and analysis tools

## Code Structure and Maintainability

### 1. **Function modularization**
   - **Current**: Some functions (like `traverse_local_repos`) are quite long
   - **Improvement**: Break large functions into smaller, single-purpose functions
   - **Benefit**: Improved readability, testability, and maintainability

### 2. **Testing framework**
   - **Current**: No formal testing structure
   - **Improvement**: Add `--test` mode and unit tests for critical functions
   - **Benefit**: Better reliability and easier debugging

### 3. **Configuration validation**
   - **Current**: Basic configuration loading
   - **Improvement**: Add comprehensive config validation with helpful error messages
   - **Benefit**: Better user experience and fewer runtime errors

## Security Considerations

### 1. **Enhanced file operations security**
   - **Current**: Basic file operations with some safety checks
   - **Improvement**: Stricter permission validation and safer temporary file handling
   - **Benefit**: Reduced security risks in multi-user environments

### 2. **Input sanitization enhancement**
   - **Current**: Basic input validation
   - **Improvement**: More comprehensive validation for all user inputs and config values
   - **Benefit**: Protection against injection attacks and malformed data

## Usability Enhancements

### 1. **Interactive operation mode**
   - **Current**: Command-line operation only
   - **Improvement**: Add interactive mode for confirming large operations
   - **Benefit**: Better user control and safety for critical operations

### 2. **Enhanced progress reporting**
   - **Current**: Basic progress information
   - **Improvement**: Detailed progress bars and operation summaries
   - **Benefit**: Better visibility into long-running operations

### 3. **Configuration templates and validation**
   - **Current**: Example configuration in documentation
   - **Improvement**: Built-in config templates and validation tools
   - **Benefit**: Easier setup and fewer configuration errors

## 2025-06 Improvements Recap

### Performance
- **Repository metadata cache versioning & dependency tracking**: Smarter invalidation, not just time-based.
- **Dynamic parallel job scheduling**: Adjust parallelism based on system load/resources.
- **Batch DNF operations**: Group downloads/queries for efficiency.

### Error Handling & Logging
- **Exponential backoff for transient errors**: Retry with increasing delay.
- **Log rotation/archival**: Prevent log bloat, keep history.
- **Structured (JSON) logging option**: For automation and monitoring tools.

### Code Quality & Maintainability
- **Function modularization**: Break up large functions for clarity and testability.
- **Testing framework**: Add `--test` mode and unit tests for key logic.
- **Comprehensive config validation**: Early, user-friendly error messages for config issues.

### Security
- **Safer file operations**: Stricter permissions, secure temp file handling.
- **Input sanitization**: Validate all user/config input to prevent injection or errors.

### Usability
- **Interactive mode**: Prompt user for confirmation on large/critical actions.
- **Detailed progress reporting**: Progress bars, summaries, and ETA.
- **Config templates and validation tools**: Easier setup, fewer mistakes.

**Priority:**
- ðŸ”´ High: Cache prediction, error recovery, config validation
- ðŸŸ¡ Medium: Log rotation, modularization, progress reporting
- ðŸŸ¢ Low: Interactive mode, structured logging, security enhancements
