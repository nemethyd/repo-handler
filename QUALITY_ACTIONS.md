### Quality & Maintenance Roadmap

This document tracks identified quality, consistency, and maintainability improvements for `myrepo.sh`.

Last Reviewed: 2025-08-17

## Completed Items

| ID | Area | Summary |
|----|------|---------|
| 1 | Structure | Restored readable `batch_download_packages` formatting |
| 2 | Structure | Decomposed monolith into focused functions |
| 3 | Logging | Centralized verbosity filtering / standardized levels |
| 4 | Fallback Logic | Adaptive shrinking + regrow implemented |
| 5 | Counters | Negative counter guards + clamp logic |
| 6 | Helpers | Added helper trio (manual repo / epoch / dir ensure) |
| 8 | Metadata | Prevented double metadata updates for manual repos |
| 17 | Emojis | Standardized emoji set + conditional prefixing |
| 10 | Safety | Bash version guard + safe_rm_rf path confinement |
| 7 | Performance | Indexed repo packages for O(1) lookups |
| 14 | Version Compare | Added tests for `version_is_newer` edge cases |

## Prioritized Backlog

Ordered by: (1) Safety/Correctness, (2) Functional integrity, (3) Performance, (4) Testability, (5) UX/Outputs, (6) Developer ergonomics, (7) Deferred refactors / cosmetic cleanup.

| Priority | ID | Area | Description | Status | Rationale |
|----------|----|------|-------------|--------|-----------|
| 2 | 9  | Testing | `--self-test` mode (tool presence, perms) returning JSON/exit codes | TODO | Fast environment validation & CI hook |
| 3 | 15 | Hook Names | Namespace test hooks (`MYREPO_TEST_*`) centrally | TODO | Prevents collisions; improves clarity for tests |
| 4 | 12 | Output | `--json-summary` machine-readable results alongside table | TODO | Enables integration / automation |
| 5 | 18 | Output | No-emoji / plain mode (map emojis to INFO/WARN/ERR/OK) | TODO | Terminal compatibility / log parsers |
| 6 | 11 | Docs | Tunables reference + initial CHANGELOG.md | TODO | Documentation debt reduction; supports users |
| 7 | 13 | Refactor | Split into modular libs (`lib_*`) once stable | LATER | Defer until feature churn settles |
| 8 | 16 | Cleanup | Remove legacy historical comments | LATER | Cosmetic; safe last |

## Notes on Backlog Ordering

1. With performance indexing (Point 7) now done, version comparison tests (Point 14) lead to lock correctness.
2. Self-test mode (Point 9) improves diagnosability before expanding outputs.
3. Output enhancements (Points 12, 18) follow a stable core for predictable schemas.
4. Documentation (Point 11) after feature shape solidifies.
5. Refactor and cosmetic cleanup (Points 13, 16) deferred until churn subsides.

## Conventions

* Function Ordering: Prefer logical lifecycle grouping (config ‚Üí environment checks ‚Üí helpers ‚Üí processing ‚Üí metadata ‚Üí sync/reporting ‚Üí validation ‚Üí main) over strict alphabetical.
* Logging: Standardized emoji usage (enforced in log()): `üìò` info, `‚ö†Ô∏è` warning, `‚ùå` error, `‚è≥` progress, `‚úÖ` success (with planned plain mode fallback).
* Test Hooks: All future hooks prefixed with `MYREPO_TEST_`.
