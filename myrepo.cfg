# MAGIC_NUMBER_RETRY_LIMIT=3         # Number of retry attempts for magic number processing

# Number of parallel repoquery jobs for metadata fetching (default: 4)
# Increase for faster metadata updates if you have many repos and sufficient CPU/network.

# Repository metadata compression type (default: zstd)
# Supported values: gz (gzip), zstd, xz, bz2
# zstd provides best compression ratio and speed for modern systems

# Adaptive Performance Tuning Settings
# These settings control the adaptive batch size and parallelism mechanism that automatically
# adjusts processing parameters based on performance metrics to optimize throughput.

# Enable adaptive tuning (1 = enabled, 0 = disabled)
# When enabled, the script will dynamically adjust BATCH_SIZE and PARALLEL based on performance
# ADAPTIVE_TUNING=1

# Minimum batch size for adaptive tuning (optimized default: 20)
# The adaptive mechanism will not reduce batch size below this value
# MIN_BATCH_SIZE=20

# Maximum batch size for adaptive tuning  
# The adaptive mechanism will not increase batch size above this value
# MAX_BATCH_SIZE=100

# Minimum number of parallel processes for adaptive tuning
# The adaptive mechanism will not reduce parallelism below this value
# MIN_PARALLEL=1

# Maximum number of parallel processes for adaptive tuning
# The adaptive mechanism will not increase parallelism above this value
# MAX_PARALLEL=8

# Number of performance samples to collect before making adjustments
# A larger sample size provides more stable performance measurements but slower adaptation
# PERFORMANCE_SAMPLE_SIZE=5

# Interval for running adaptive tuning adjustments (in number of batches processed)
# Tuning will be performed every N batches to avoid excessive adjustments
# TUNE_INTERVAL=3

# Efficiency threshold percentage for adaptive tuning (optimized default: 60)
# If efficiency drops below this percentage, the adaptive mechanism will attempt adjustments
# Lower values make the system more aggressive about optimizing performance
# EFFICIENCY_THRESHOLD=60
