# MyRepo Configuration File - Version 2.3.5
# Performance-optimized configuration for high-speed repository management
# 
# This version has been optimized for maximum performance by removing complex
# adaptive features in favor of simple, reliable, fast operation.
# The default values are given below, commented out.
# To configure, uncomment the desired lines and change the values.

# === REMOVED IN v2.3.5 (Performance Optimization) ===
# The following complex features have been removed for better performance:
# - Repository performance tracking and load balancing (REPO_PERF_* settings)
# - Adaptive batch sizing (ADAPTIVE_BATCH_SIZE_* settings)  
# - Complex performance monitoring arrays and calculations
# - Repository priority scoring and intelligent prioritization
# - Load balancing thresholds and performance cache files
# These have been replaced with simple, fast, optimal fixed settings.

# === DIRECTORY CONFIGURATION ===
# All directory paths must exist and be writable by the user running the script.

# Set the local repository path (base directory containing the repository tree)
# LOCAL_REPO_PATH="/repo"
# IMPORTANT: This directory and all its subdirectories must be writable.

# Set the shared repository path  
# SHARED_REPO_PATH="/mnt/hgfs/ForVMware/ol9_repos"
# IMPORTANT: This directory must be writable for repository synchronization.

# Define manual repositories (comma-separated)
# MANUAL_REPOS="ol9_edge"
# These are individual repositories within the LOCAL_REPO_PATH tree.

# Define local RPM source directories (comma-separated)
# LOCAL_RPM_SOURCES="/home/nemethy/rpmbuild/RPMS,/var/cache/dnf,/var/cache/yum,/tmp"
# These directories will be searched for locally built or cached RPM packages
# Useful for including packages from rpmbuild, custom builds, or cached downloads
# The script will search these locations before attempting to download packages
# 
# Common locations to include:
# - ~/rpmbuild/RPMS (your local builds)
# - /var/cache/dnf (DNF cached packages)  
# - /var/cache/yum (legacy YUM cache)
# - /tmp (temporary RPM files)
# - Custom build directories

# === DEBUG AND LOGGING ===

# Set verbosity level (0=critical, 1=important, 2=normal, 3=verbose)
# DEBUG_LEVEL=1

# === PROCESSING CONFIGURATION ===

# Set maximum number of packages to process (0 = no limit)
# MAX_PACKAGES=0

# Set maximum number of new packages to download (-1 = no limit, 0 = none)  
# MAX_NEW_PACKAGES=-1

# Set the number of parallel processes (optimized default: 6)
# PARALLEL=6

# Enable dry run mode (1 = enabled, 0 = disabled)
# DRY_RUN=0

# Enforce full rebuild (1 = enabled, 0 = disabled)
# This will remove all packages in the local repository before rebuilding
# FULL_REBUILD=0

# === REPOSITORY FILTERING ===

# Define excluded repositories (comma-separated)
# These repositories will be ignored during processing
# EXCLUDE_REPOS=""

# === CACHE AND PERFORMANCE CONFIGURATION ===

# Cache validity in seconds (default: 14400 = 4 hours)
# Controls how long repository metadata cache remains valid
# CACHE_MAX_AGE=14400

# Shared cache directory path (default: /var/cache/myrepo)
# SHARED_CACHE_PATH="/var/cache/myrepo"

# Enable cleanup of uninstalled packages (1 = enabled, 0 = disabled)
# When enabled, packages that are no longer installed will be removed from local repositories
# CLEANUP_UNINSTALLED=1

# Enable parallel compression for createrepo (1 = enabled, 0 = disabled)
# When enabled, uses multiple workers for faster repository metadata creation
# USE_PARALLEL_COMPRESSION=1

# === ADVANCED OPTIONS ===

# Force refresh of DNF metadata cache and rebuild repository cache (1 = enabled, 0 = disabled)
# REFRESH_METADATA=0

# Use serial DNF mode to prevent database lock contention (1 = enabled, 0 = disabled)
# Enable this if you experience DNF database locking issues
# DNF_SERIAL=0

# Automatic privilege detection (1 = auto-detect, 0 = never use sudo)
# The script automatically detects execution context:
# - When running as user (EUID!=0): Uses 'sudo dnf' automatically
# - When running as root (EUID=0): Uses 'dnf' directly
# Override with 0 only if you want to disable automatic sudo (advanced use only)
# ELEVATE_COMMANDS=1

# === TIMEOUT CONFIGURATION ===

# Timeout for basic DNF queries (in seconds)
# DNF_QUERY_TIMEOUT=60

# Timeout for DNF cache building operations (in seconds)  
# DNF_CACHE_TIMEOUT=120

# Timeout for DNF download operations (in seconds, default: 1800 = 30 minutes)
# DNF_DOWNLOAD_TIMEOUT=1800

# === PROGRESS AND MONITORING ===

# Progress update interval for download operations (in seconds, default: 30)
# Controls how often progress updates are shown during large downloads
# PROGRESS_UPDATE_INTERVAL=30

# Report progress every N packages (default: 50)
# PROGRESS_REPORT_INTERVAL=50

# === PERFORMANCE TUNING (Optimized for Speed) ===

# Simple batch size for optimal performance (default: 50)
# All batch operations use this fixed optimal size for maximum speed
# SIMPLE_BATCH_SIZE=50

# Maximum lines to read from config file (security limit)
# CONFIG_FILE_MAX_LINES=500

# DNF parallel downloads (default: 8)
# MAX_PARALLEL_DOWNLOADS=8

# DNF retry attempts (default: 2)
# DNF_RETRIES=2

# Progress and threshold settings (configurable to eliminate magic numbers)
# Large batch threshold for progress reporting (default: 200)
# LARGE_BATCH_THRESHOLD=200

# Progress batch threshold for periodic updates (default: 50) 
# PROGRESS_BATCH_THRESHOLD=50

# Package list display threshold (default: 100)
# PACKAGE_LIST_THRESHOLD=100

# ETA display threshold in seconds (default: 60)
# ETA_DISPLAY_THRESHOLD=60

# Debug file list threshold (default: 10)
# DEBUG_FILE_LIST_THRESHOLD=10

# Debug file list count (default: 5)
# DEBUG_FILE_LIST_COUNT=5

# === DIRECTORY PERMISSIONS (Configurable) ===

# Default directory permissions (octal, default: 755)
# DEFAULT_DIR_PERMISSIONS=755

# Shared cache directory permissions (octal, default: 1777 with sticky bit)
# SHARED_CACHE_PERMISSIONS=1777

# Cache file permissions (octal, default: 644)
# CACHE_FILE_PERMISSIONS=644

# === LEGACY OPTIONS NO LONGER SUPPORTED ===
# The following options from previous versions are no longer supported:
# - SET_PERMISSIONS (permission handling is now automatic)
# - LOG_DIR (logging is now to stderr, no file logging)
# - EXCLUDED_REPOS (renamed to EXCLUDE_REPOS for consistency)
# - RPMBUILD_PATH (use LOCAL_RPM_SOURCES array instead)
# - CONTINUE_ON_ERROR (error handling is now consistent)
# - Complex cache settings like CACHE_MAX_AGE_HOURS, NIGHT_START_HOUR, etc.
# - Repository compression settings (now use optimal defaults)
# - AUTO_UPDATE_MANUAL_REPOS (now always enabled)
# - LOCAL_REPO_CHECK_METHOD (optimized for performance)
# - GROUP_OUTPUT (output is now consistently formatted)
# - All complex performance tracking variables (removed for speed optimization)
