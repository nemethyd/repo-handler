# Central ShellCheck configuration to reduce repeated Problems entries for myrepo.sh
# All exclusions previously scattered inline are centralized here.
# Adjust this list rather than adding many inline `# shellcheck disable=...` comments.
# You can temporarily comment out lines to re-enable a rule for auditing.

# Target shell
shell=bash

# No global excludes; individual cases documented inline for clarity.

# You can run `shellcheck myrepo.sh` manually; this file will be autoâ€‘detected.
